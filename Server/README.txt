MAGICULTURE 1.12.2 SERVER FILES
Version 0.4.0.0

TO BEGIN: Run forge-XXXXX.jar and the server will generate a file called EULA - open this and change the line to read EULA = TRUE in order to accept mojang's server use agreement. Then, run forge-XXXXX.jar again to start the server.

TO UPDATE TO A NEWER VERSION: Delete the folders called "mods", "config", "resources", "scripts", and "libraries", as well as the forge-1.12.2.jar file. Then, replace these with the folders and forge jar from the new server pack. Keep your server.properties file and "world" folder the same.

It is HIGHLY recommended to run a modded server with 4+ GB of allocated ram.

To help with server chunk loading times, I recommend Chunk Pregenerator.

REGARDING SPONGE: Some server owners have reported an issue where players drop their inventory twice when running sponge. If you are encountering this, try disabling the "inventory module" of the CorpseComplex mod. This can be done by finding the file "corpsecomplex.cfg" in the "configs" folder and setting the line B:"Enable Inventory Module"=true to =false. This will disable the feature where some items are kept on death, but should fix the sponge incompatibility.

Thanks so much for trying out our pack with your friends! Hope you enjoy!
